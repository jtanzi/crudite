{"name":"Crudite","tagline":"Meal Planning application using Node.js and MongoDB","body":"### Welcome to the Crudite Project Page\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\nCrudite is a meal-planning application designed to solve a household need for meal planning (something I've never really liked to do).  The ultimate goal is to create a web application that supports the full range of CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) and allow one to select a set of recipes one plans to make, and generate a grocery list from that selection.\r\n\r\nThis project is still under development and currently supports creating a recipe, viewing recipes, and deleting recipes.  Features still to be added are updating recipes, more robust error handling, recipe querying and selecting, and grocery list generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2015 @jtanzi \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
